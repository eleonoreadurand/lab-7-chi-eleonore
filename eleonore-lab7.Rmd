This: I'm Eleonore and I'm updating this markdown file here.  

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")


```


We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get?)


```{r}
# Is it Thanksgiving yet? (Sam)

library(kableExtra)
```


Eleonore: data wrangling and counts 

```{r}


get_guns<- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% #filter out the NA values 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) #for each level of the gender column, counts responses


```
